					Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
					the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
					or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is
					a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
					CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including
					layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;
					provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
					characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
					the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
					repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached
					to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and
					its formatting. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible
					to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
					methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
					or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules
					for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
					The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
					which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
					This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are
					maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
					(MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March
					1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
					In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including
					XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. Syntax CSS has a simple syntax and uses
					a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.
					A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists
					of one or more selectors, and a declaration block. Selector "CSS class"
					redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML, see class attribute
					(HTML). In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies
					to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself. Selectors may
					apply to the following: all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level
					headers h2 elements specified by attribute, in particular: id: an identifier
					unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash
					prefix e.g. #id class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements
					in a document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g. .classname (the phrase "CSS
					class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified
					with the HTML class attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from
					browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document
					styles; see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system
					of the Web content model) elements depending on how they are placed relative
					to others in the document tree. Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start
					with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
					A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may
					only be applied to a single element. Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors
					to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the
					document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which
					identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible element,
					usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector
					as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements,
					such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that
					may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6]
					Note the double-colon notation for pseudo-elements versus single-colon
					notation for pseudo-class. Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve
					great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple selectors may be joined
					in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class,
					or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For
					example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass
					that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies
					to all div elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is
					not to be confused with concatenated identifiers such as div.myClass {color:
					red;} which applies to div elements of class myClass. Cascading Style Sheets

					refers to the relative weights of various rules.[16] It determines which
					styles apply to an element when more than one rule could apply. Based on
					the specification, a simple selector (e.g. H1) has a specificity of 1,
					class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID selectors have a specificity
					of 1,0,0. Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decimal
					system, commas are used to separate the "digits"[17] (a CSS rule having
					11 elements and 11 classes would have a specificity of 11,11, not 121).

					20px src: url('first.example.com'), url('second.example.com'), url('third.example.com'),
					url('fourth.example.com'), } Positioning CSS 2.1 defines three positioning
					schemes: Normal flow Inline items are laid out in the same way as the letters
					in words in the text, one after the other across the available space until
					there is no more room, then starting a new line below. Block items stack
					vertically, like paragraphs and like the items in a bulleted list. Normal
					flow also includes the relative positioning of block or inline items and
					run-in boxes. Floats A floated item is taken out of the normal flow and
					shifted to the left or right as far as possible in the space available.
					Other content then flows alongside the floated item. Absolute positioning
					An absolutely positioned item has no place in, and no effect on, the normal
					flow of other items. It occupies its assigned position in its container
					independently of other items.[20] Position property There are five possible
					values of the position property. If an item is positioned in any way other
					than static, then the further properties top, bottom, left, and right are
					used to specify offsets and positions.The element having position static
					is not affected by the top, bottom , left or right properties. Static The
					default value places the item in the normal flow Relative The item is placed
					in the normal flow, and then shifted or offset from that position. Subsequent
					flow items are laid out as if the item had not been moved. Absolute Specifies
					absolute positioning. The element is positioned in relation to its nearest
					non-static ancestor. Fixed The item is absolutely positioned in a fixed
					position on the screen even as the rest of the document is scrolled[20]
					Float and clear The float property may have one of three values. Absolutely
					positioned or fixed items cannot be floated. Other elements normally flow
					around floated items, unless they are prevented from doing so by their
					clear property. left The item floats to the left of the line that it would
					have appeared in; other items may flow around its right side. right The
					item floats to the right of the line that it would have appeared in; other
					items may flow around its left side. clear Forces the element to appear
					underneath ('clear') floated elements to the left (clear:left), right (clear:right)
					or both sides (clear:both).[20][21] History Whitespace The whitespace between

					specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3[23]
					was released that year, featuring some limited support for CSS. IE 4 and
					Netscape 4.x added more support, but it was typically incomplete and had
					many bugs that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than
					three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of
					the specification. Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh, shipped in
					March 2000, was the first browser to have full (better than 99 percent)
					CSS 1 support,[33] surpassing Opera, which had been the leader since its
					introduction of CSS support fifteen months earlier. Other browsers followed
					soon afterward, and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS
					2.[citation needed] However, even when later "version 5" web browsers began
					to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS, they were still incorrect
					in certain areas. They were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs, and other
					quirks. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5. x for Windows, as opposed to the
					very different IE for Macintosh, had a flawed implementation of the CSS
					box model, as compared with the CSS standards. Such inconsistencies and
					variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve
					a consistent appearance across browsers and platforms without the use of
					workarounds termed CSS hacks and filters. The IE Windows box model bugs
					were so serious that, when Internet Explorer 6 was released, Microsoft
					introduced a backward-compatible mode of CSS interpretation ("quirks mode")
					alongside an alternative, corrected "standards mode". Other non-Microsoft
					browsers also provided mode-switch capabilities. It, therefore, became
					necessary for authors of HTML files to ensure they contained special distinctive
					"standards-compliant CSS intended" marker to show that the authors intended
					CSS to be interpreted correctly, in compliance with standards, as opposed
					to being intended for the now long-obsolete IE5/Windows browser. Without
					this marker, web browsers with the "quirks mode"-switching capability will
					size objects in web pages as IE 5 on Windows would, rather than following
					CSS standards.[citation needed] Problems with the patchy adoption of CSS
					and errata in the original specification led the W3C to revise the CSS
					2 standards into CSS 2.1, which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current
					CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS 2 properties that no browser successfully
					implemented were dropped, and in a few cases, defined behaviors were changed
					to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing implementations.
					CSS 2.1 became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but CSS
					2.1 was pulled back to Working Draft status on June 13, 2005,[34] and only
					returned to Candidate Recommendation status on July 19, 2007.[35] In addition
					to these problems, the .css extension was used by a software product used
					to convert PowerPoint files into Compact Slide Show files,[36] so some
					web servers served all .css[37] as MIME type application/x-pointplus[38]
					rather than text/css. Vendor prefixes Individual browser vendors occasionally
					introduced new parameters ahead of standardization and universalization.
					To prevent interfering with future implementations, vendors prepended unique
					names to the parameters, such as -moz- for Mozilla Firefox, -webkit- named
					after the browsing engine of Apple Safari, -o- for Opera Browser and -ms-
					for Microsoft Internet Explorer and early versions of Microsoft Edge that
					use EdgeHTML. Occasionally, the parameters with vendor prefixes such as
					-moz-radial-gradient and -webkit-linear-gradient have slightly different
					syntax as compared to their non-vendor-prefix counterparts.[39] Prefixed
					properties are rendered obsolete by the time of standardization. Programs
					are available to automatically add prefixes for older browsers and to point
					out standardized versions of prefixed parameters. Since prefixes are limited
					to a small subset of browsers, removing the prefix allows other browsers
					to see the functionality. An exception is certain obsolete -webkit- prefixed
					properties, which are so common and persistent on the web that other families
					of browsers have decided to support them for compatibility.[40] Variations
					CSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the
					last, typically adding new features and typically denoted[citation needed]
					as CSS 1, CSS 2, CSS 3, and CSS 4. Profiles are typically a subset of one
					or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface.
					Currently, there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television
					sets. Profiles should not be confused with media types, which were added
					in CSS 2. CSS 1 The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation
					is CSS level 1, published on 17 December 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert
					Bos are credited as the original developers.[41][42] Among its capabilities
					are support for Font properties such as typeface and emphasis Color of
					text, backgrounds, and other elements Text attributes such as spacing between
					words, letters, and lines of text Alignment of text, images, tables and
					other elements Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements
					Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes
					The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.[43] CSS 2 CSS level
					2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation
					in May 1998. A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities
					like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements and z-index,
					the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which were
					later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules)[44] and bidirectional text,
					and new font properties such as shadows. The W3C no longer maintains the
					CSS 2 recommendation.[45] CSS 2.1 CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred
					to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported or not
					fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions
					to the specification. To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing
					technical specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft
					status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first
					became a Candidate Recommendation on 25 February 2004, but it was reverted
					to a Working Draft on 13 June 2005 for further review. It returned to Candidate
					Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated twice in 2009. However,
					because changes and clarifications were made, it again went back to Last
					Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010. CSS 2.1 went to Proposed Recommendation
					on 12 April 2011.[46] After being reviewed by the W3C Advisory Committee,
					it was finally published as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2011.[47] CSS
					2.1 was planned as the first and final revision of level 2—but low-priority
					work on CSS 2.2 began in 2015. CSS 3 "CSS3" redirects here. For other uses,
					see CSS3 (disambiguation). Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification
					defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents
					called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features
					defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level
					3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation.
					The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.[48] Due to the modularization,
					different modules have different stability and statuses.[49] Some modules
					have Candidate Recommendation (CR) status and are considered moderately
					stable. At CR stage, implementations are advised to drop vendor prefixes.[50]
					CSS 4 CSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon
					the last, typically adding new features and typically denoted[citation
					needed] as CSS 1, CSS 2, CSS 3, and CSS 4. Profiles are typically a subset
					of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface.
					Currently, there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television
					sets. Profiles should not be confused with media types, which were added
					in CSS 2. CSS 1 The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation
					is CSS level 1, published on 17 December 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert
					Bos are credited as the original developers.[41][42] Among its capabilities
					are support for Font properties such as typeface and emphasis Color of
					text, backgrounds, and other elements Text attributes such as spacing between
					words, letters, and lines of text Alignment of text, images, tables and
					other elements Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements
					Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes
					The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.[43] CSS 2 CSS level
					2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation
					in May 1998. A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities
					like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements and z-index,
					the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which were
					later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules)[44] and bidirectional text,
					and new font properties such as shadows. The W3C no longer maintains the
					CSS 2 recommendation.[45] CSS 2.1 CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred
					to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported or not
					fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions
					to the specification. To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing
					technical specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft
					status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first
					became a Candidate Recommendation on 25 February 2004, but it was reverted
					to a Working Draft on 13 June 2005 for further review. It returned to Candidate
					Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated twice in 2009. However,
					because changes and clarifications were made, it again went back to Last
					Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010. CSS 2.1 went to Proposed Recommendation
					on 12 April 2011.[46] After being reviewed by the W3C Advisory Committee,
					it was finally published as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2011.[47] CSS
					2.1 was planned as the first and final revision of level 2—but low-priority
					work on CSS 2.2 began in 2015. CSS 3 "CSS3" redirects here. For other uses,
					see CSS3 (disambiguation). Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification
					defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents
					called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features
					defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level
					3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation.
					The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.[48] Due to the modularization,
					different modules have different stability and statuses.[49] Some modules
					have Candidate Recommendation (CR) status and are considered moderately
					stable. At CR stage, implementations are advised to drop vendor prefixes.[50]
					Browser support Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages,
					and support for CSS functionality is not consistent between them. Because
					browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding techniques have been
					developed to target specific browsers with workarounds (commonly known
					as CSS hacks or CSS filters). The adoption of new functionality in CSS
					can be hindered by a lack of support in major browsers. For example, Internet
					Explorer was slow to add support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed
					the adoption of those features and damaged the browser's reputation among
					developers. Additionally, a proprietary syntax for the non-vendor-prefixed
					filter property was used in some versions.[62] In order to ensure a consistent
					experience for their users, web developers often test their sites across
					multiple operating systems, browsers, and browser versions, increasing
					development time and complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built
					to reduce the complexity of maintaining these environments. In addition
					to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of browser support for
					specific CSS properties, including CanIUse and the MDN Web Docs. Additionally,
					CSS 3 defines feature queries, which provide an @supports directive that
					will allow developers to target browsers with support for certain functionality
					directly within their CSS.[63] CSS that is not supported by older browsers
					can also sometimes be patched in using JavaScript polyfills, which are
					pieces of JavaScript code designed to make browsers behave consistently.
					These workarounds—and the need to support fallback functionality—can add
					complexity to development projects, and consequently, companies frequently
					define a list of browser versions that they will and will not support.
					As websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible with older
					browsers, these browsers can be cut off from accessing many of the resources
					on the web (sometimes intentionally).[64] Many of the most popular sites
					on the internet are not just visually degraded on older browsers due to
					poor CSS support but do not work at all, in large part due to the evolution
					of JavaScript and other web technologies. Limitations Some noted limitations
					of the current capabilities of CSS include: Cannot explicitly declare new
					scope independently of position Scoping rules for properties such as z-index
					look for the closest parent element with a position: absolute or position:
					relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired effects. For example,
					it is impossible to avoid declaring a new scope when one is forced to adjust
					an element's position, preventing one from using the desired scope of a
					parent element. Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable CSS implements
					pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user feedback by conditional application
					of alternate styles. One CSS pseudo-class, ":hover", is dynamic (equivalent
					of JavaScript "onmouseover") and has potential for misuse (e.g., implementing
					cursor-proximity popups),[65] but CSS has no ability for a client to disable
					it (no "disable"-like property) or limit its effects (no "nochange"-like
					values for each property). Cannot name rules There is no way to name a
					CSS rule, which would allow (for example) client-side scripts to refer
					to the rule even if its selector changes. Cannot include styles from a
					rule into another rule CSS styles often must be duplicated in several rules
					to achieve the desired effect, causing additional maintenance and requiring
					more thorough testing. Some new CSS features were proposed to solve this
					but were abandoned afterward.[66][67] Instead, authors may gain this ability
					by using more sophisticated stylesheet languages which compile to CSS,
					such as Sass, Less, or Stylus. Cannot target specific text without altering
					markup Besides the :first-letter pseudo-element, one cannot target specific
					ranges of text without needing to utilize place-holder elements. Advantages
					Separation of content from presentation Main article: Separation of content
					and presentation CSS facilitates the publication of content in multiple
					presentation formats based on nominal parameters. Nominal parameters include
					explicit user preferences, different web browsers, the type of device being
					used to view the content (a desktop computer or mobile device), the geographic
					location of the user, and many other variables. Site-wide consistency Main
					article: Style sheet (web development) When CSS is used effectively, in
					terms of inheritance and "cascading", a global style sheet can be used
					to affect and style elements site-wide. If the situation arises that the
					styling of the elements should be changed or adjusted, these changes can
					be made by editing rules in the global style sheet. Before CSS, this sort
					of maintenance was more difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. Bandwidth
					A stylesheet, internal or external, specifies the style once for a range
					of HTML elements selected by class, type or relationship to others. This
					is much more efficient than repeating style information inline for each
					occurrence of the element. An external stylesheet is usually stored in
					the browser cache, and can therefore be used on multiple pages without
					being reloaded, further reducing data transfer over a network. Page reformatting
					Main article: Progressive enhancement With a simple change of one line,
					a different style sheet can be used for the same page. This has advantages
					for accessibility, as well as providing the ability to tailor a page or
					site to different target devices. Furthermore, devices not able to understand
					the styling still display the content. Accessibility Without CSS, web designers
					must typically lay out their pages with techniques such as HTML tables
					that hinder accessibility for vision-impaired users (see Tableless web
					design#Accessibility). Standardization Frameworks Main article: CSS framework
					CSS frameworks are pre-prepared libraries that are meant to allow for easier,
					more standards-compliant styling of web pages using the Cascading Style
					Sheets language. CSS frameworks include Blueprint, Bootstrap, Foundation
					and Materialize. Like programming and scripting language libraries, CSS
					frameworks are usually incorporated as external .css sheets referenced
					in the HTML They provide a number of ready-made options for designing and
					laying out the web page. Although many of these frameworks have been published,
					some authors use them mostly for rapid prototyping, or for learning from,
					and prefer to 'handcraft' CSS that is appropriate to each published site
					without the design, maintenance and download overhead of having many unused
					features in the site's styling.[68] Design methodologies As the size of
					CSS resources used in a project increases, a development team often needs
					to decide on a common design methodology to keep them organized. The goals
					are ease of development, ease of collaboration during development, and
					performance of the deployed stylesheets in the browser. Popularmethodologies
					include OOCSS (object-oriented CSS), ACSS (atomic CSS), CSS (organic Cascade
					Style Sheet), SMACSS (scalable and modular architecture for CSS), and BEM
					(block, element, modifier).[69] *Wikipedia
