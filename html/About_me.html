        <section>
          <p class="two_columns">I was born as the second child of Cesar (AKA Coco) and Maria (Mary) in Arequipa on 1974, when I was in pre-school I went to an institution that was close from home, -I cannot remember its name, after that year I went to a School named "La Salle" and there studied for three years, then my family moved to Lima and I did my fourth year in "La Salle" from Lima, after that, my family moved again and I did my fifth year in "La Salle" from Lima again, then we moved to a small town called "Andahuasi", where I studied for 4 months, then we moved to a School called "James Monroe" in Lima and that was it for the primary school. My father was hired for a big mining company with its main location in a city called "La Oroya" and they had a 600 student school for the engineers and university staff, it was called "Mayupampa" and I attended there for the last 5 years of High School, it was a dream school, my house was really close to the school, less than 10 minutes walking, besides all the neighbors worked for the company, and t was protected by guards, almost 0 crimes. When I was in the second year of high-school my dad bought a computer, but not like most of my other fellow students (commodore 64) had, he bought a Intel 8086 based, that proved useful with the years. In the computer's lab they had many Apple IIEs, that was my first approach to the computers. When I finished school I decided for dentistry and as I had asthma I went to study to the University in Arequipa, there my aunt had a computer and I lived in her house, in the University they had a big computer's lab implemented with Apple computers connected with a "magical" thing called "Internet", I tried to spend most of my time in the lab, also I had my first girlfriend when I was in the second year. When I finnisehd dentistry I returned to La Oroya to work as a dentist, and I did it, for 13 years. After that period I met my wife in Huancayo, where I still live (actually I met her when I used to go to Huancayo's discos). I started working as a Freelance translator (what I still do) and studied a bachelor in Computers Science in a University from the US, after that I studied coding, with the promise of earning more money working from Home, like my work as a dentist, which I do at home. Wish me good luck!
