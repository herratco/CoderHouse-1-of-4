					Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run
					on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript
					runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and executes JavaScript
					code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write
					command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript
					code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before
					the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents
					a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development
					around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages
					for the server- versus client-side programming. Node.js has an event-driven
					architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize
					throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations,
					as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication
					programs and browser games).[7] The Node.js distributed development project
					was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged
					with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation
					is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9]
					Corporate users of Node.js software include GoDaddy,[10] Groupon,[11] IBM,[12]
					LinkedIn,[13][14] Microsoft,[15][16] Netflix,[17] PayPal,[18][19] SAP,[20]
					Walmart,[21] Yahoo!,[22] and Amazon Web Services.[23] History Node.js was
					written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009,[24] about thirteen years after
					the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's
					LiveWire Pro Web.[25] The initial release supported only Linux and Mac
					OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored
					by Joyent.[26] Dahl criticized the limited possibilities of the most popular
					web server in 2009, Apache HTTP Server, to handle a lot of concurrent connections
					(up to 10,000 and more) and the most common way of creating code (sequential
					programming), when code either blocked the entire process or implied multiple
					execution stacks in the case of simultaneous connections.[27] Dahl demonstrated
					the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009.[28][29][30]
					Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level
					I/O API.[31] In January 2010, a package manager was introduced for the
					Node.js environment called npm.[32] The package manager makes it easier
					for programmers to publish and share source code of Node.js packages and
					is designed to simplify installation, updating, and uninstallation of packages.[31]
					In June 2011, Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version
					of Node.js.[33] The first Node.js build supporting Windows was released
					in July 2011. In January 2012, Dahl stepped aside, promoting coworker and
					npm creator Isaac Schlueter to manage the project.[34] In January 2014,
					Schlueter announced that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.[35]
					In December 2014, Fedor Indutny started io.js, a fork of Node.js. Due to
					the internal conflict over Joyent's governance, io.js was created as an
					open governance alternative with a separate technical committee.[36][37]
					Unlike Node.js,[38] the authors planned to keep io.js up-to-date with the
					latest releases of the Google V8 JavaScript engine.[39] In February 2015,
					the intent to form a neutral Node.js Foundation was announced. By June
					2015, the Node.js and io.js communities voted to work together under the
					Node.js Foundation.[40] In September 2015, Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3
					were merged back together into Node v4.0.[41] This merge brought V8 ES6
					features into Node.js and a long-term support release cycle.[42] As of
					2016, the io.js website recommends that developers switch back to Node.js
					and that no further releases of io.js are planned due to the merge.[43]
					In 2019, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS
					Foundation. On February 21 2023, Node.js 19.7.0 was released.[44] Overview
					Node.js allows the creation of Web servers and networking tools using JavaScript
					and a collection of "modules" that handle various core functionalities.[28][31][45][46][47]
					Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL,
					or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography functions, data streams, and
					other core functions.[31][46][48] Node.js's modules use an API designed
					to reduce the complexity of writing server applications.[31][46] JavaScript
					is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many compile-to-JS
					languages are available.[49] As a result, Node.js applications can be written
					in CoffeeScript,[50] Dart, TypeScript, ClojureScript and others. Node.js
					is primarily used to build network programs such as Web servers.[45] The
					most significant difference between Node.js and PHP is that most functions
					in PHP block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands
					finish), while Node.js functions are non-blocking (commands execute concurrently
					or even in parallel,[51][52] and use callbacks to signal completion or
					failure).[45] Node.js is officially supported on Linux, macOS and Microsoft
					Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 (and later),[3] with tier 2 support for SmartOS
					and IBM AIX and experimental support for FreeBSD. OpenBSD also works, and
					LTS versions available for IBM i (AS/400).[53] The provided source code
					may also be built on similar operating systems to those officially supported
					or be modified by third parties to support others such as NonStop OS[54]
					and Unix servers. Platform architecture Node.js brings event-driven programming
					to web servers, enabling development of fast web servers in JavaScript.[31]
					Developers can create scalable servers without using threading, by using
					a simplified model of event-driven programming that uses callbacks to signal
					the completion of a task.[31] Node.js connects the ease of a scripting
					language (JavaScript) with the power of Unix network programming.[31] Node.js
					was built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine since it was open-sourced
					under the BSD license. It is proficient with internet fundamentals such
					as HTTP, DNS, and TCP.[28] JavaScript was also a well-known language, making
					Node.js accessible to the web development community.[28] Industry support
					There are thousands of open-source libraries for Node.js, most of them
					hosted on the npm website. There are multiple developer conferences and
					events that support the Node.js community, including NodeConf, Node Interactive,
					and Node Summit as well as a number of regional events. The open-source
					community has developed web frameworks to accelerate the development of
					applications. Such frameworks include Connect, Express.js, Socket.IO, Feathers.js,
					Koa.js, Hapi.js, Sails.js, Meteor, Derby, and many others.[31][55] Various
					packages have also been created for interfacing with other languages or
					runtime environments such as Microsoft .NET.[56] Modern desktop IDEs provide
					editing and debugging features specifically for Node.js applications. Such
					IDEs include Atom, Brackets, JetBrains WebStorm,[57][58] Microsoft Visual
					Studio (with Node.js Tools for Visual Studio,[59] or TypeScript with Node
					definitions,[60][61][62][63]) NetBeans,[64] Nodeclipse Enide Studio[65]
					(Eclipse-based), and Visual Studio Code.[66][67] Certain online web-based
					IDEs also support Node.js, such as Codeanywhere, Codenvy, Cloud9 IDE, Koding,
					and the visual flow editor in Node-RED. Node.js is supported across a number
					of cloud-hosting platforms like Jelastic, Google Cloud Platform, AWS Elastic
					Beanstalk, Joyent and others. Releases New major releases of Node.js are
					cut from the GitHub main branch every six months. Even-numbered versions
					are cut in April and odd-numbered versions are cut in October. When a new
					odd version is released, the previous even version undergoes transition
					to Long Term Support (LTS), which gives that version 18 months of active
					support from the date it is designated LTS. After these 18 months expire,
					an LTS release receives an additional 12 months of maintenance support.
					An active version receives non-breaking backports of changes a few weeks
					after they land in the current release. A maintenance release receives
					only critical fixes and documentation updates.[69] The LTS Working Group
					manages strategy and policy in collaboration with the Technical Steering
					Committee of the Node.js Foundation. New major releases of Node.js are
