					React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end
					JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces based on components.
					It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual
					developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development
					of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks
					like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with the user interface
					and rendering components to the DOM, so creating React applications usually
					requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain
					client-side functionality.[7][8] Notable Features Declarative React adheres
					to the declarative programming paradigm (a programming paradigm). Developers
					design views for each state of an application, and React updates and renders
					components when data changes. This is in contrast with imperative programming.[9]
					Components React code is made of entities called components. These components
					are reusable and must be formed in the SRC folder following the Pascal
					Case as its naming convention (capitalize camelCase). Components can be
					rendered to a particular element in the DOM using the React DOM library.
					When rendering a component, one can pass the values between components
					through "props":[10] In the above example, the name property with the value
					"Gulshan" has been passed from the Example component to the Tool component.
					Also the return section is wrapped in a tag because there is a limitation
					in the return function, it can only return a single value. So all JSX elements
					and components are bound into a single tag. The two primary ways of declaring
					components in React are through function components and class-based components.
					Functional components Function components are declared with a function
					that then returns some JSX. From React 16.8 version and above, Functional
					component can use state using Hooks. React hooks On February 16, 2019,
					React 16.8 was released to the public.[11] The release introduced React
					Hooks.[12] Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" React state
					and lifecycle features from function components.[13] Hooks do not work
					inside classes — they let developers use React without classes.[14] React
					provides a few built-in hooks like useState,[15] useContext, useReducer
					, useMemo and useEffect.[16] Others are documented in the Hooks API Reference.[17]
					useState and useEffect, which are the most commonly used, are for controlling
					state and side effects respectively. Rules of hooks There are rules of
					hooks[18] which describe the characteristic code pattern that hooks rely
					on. It is the modern way to handle state with React. Hooks should only
					be called at the top level (not inside loops or if statements). Hooks should
					only be called from React function components and custom hooks, not normal
					functions or class components. Although these rules can't be enforced at
					runtime, code analysis tools such as linters can be configured to detect
					many mistakes during development. The rules apply to both usage of hooks
					and the implementation of custom hooks,[19] which may call other hooks.
					Class-based components Class-based components are declared using ES6 classes.
					Where class components are all about the use of classes and the lifecycle
					methods, functional components have hooks to deal with state management
					and other problems which arise when writing code in React. Virtual DOM
					Another notable feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model,
					or virtual DOM. React creates an in-memory data-structure cache, computes
					the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM
					efficiently.[20] This process is called reconciliation. This allows the
					programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change,
					while the React libraries only render subcomponents that actually change.
					This selective rendering provides a major performance boost.[21] It saves
					the effort of recalculating the CSS style, layout for the page and rendering
					for the entire page.[21] Updates When ReactDOM.render[22] is called again
					for the same component and target, React takes the existing virtual DOM[23]
					it knows about last time it rendered the element tree, compares it to whatever
					new thing developers want to render, and determines which (if any) of the
					living DOM needs to change.[24] Lifecycle methods Lifecycle methods for
					class-based components use a form of hooking that allows the execution
					of code at set points during a component's lifetime. ShouldComponentUpdate
					allows the developer to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of a component
					by returning false if a render is not required. componentDidMount is called
					once the component has "mounted" (the component has been created in the
					user interface, often by associating it with a DOM node). This is commonly
					used to trigger data loading from a remote source via an API. componentWillUnmount
					is called immediately before the component is torn down or "unmounted".
					This is commonly used to clear resource-demanding dependencies to the component
					that will not simply be removed with the unmounting of the component (e.g.,
					removing any setInterval() instances that are related to the component,
					or an "eventListener" set on the "document" because of the presence of
					the component) render is the most important lifecycle method and the only
					required one in any component. It is usually called every time the component's
					state is updated, which should be reflected in the user interface. JSX
					Main article: JSX JSX, or JavaScript Syntax Extension, is an extension
					to the JavaScript language syntax.[25] Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX
					provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to
					many developers. React components are typically written using JSX, although
					they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript).
					JSX is similar to another extension syntax created by Facebook for PHP
					called XHP. Lifecycle methods for class-based components use a form of
					hooking that allows the execution of code at set points during a component's
					lifetime. ShouldComponentUpdate allows the developer to prevent unnecessary
					re-rendering of a component by returning false if a render is not required.
					componentDidMount is called once the component has "mounted" (the component
					has been created in the user interface, often by associating it with a
					DOM node). This is commonly used to trigger data loading from a remote
					source via an API. componentWillUnmount is called immediately before the
					component is torn down or "unmounted". This is commonly used to clear resource-demanding
					dependencies to the component that will not simply be removed with the
					unmounting of the component (e.g., removing any setInterval() instances
					that are related to the component, or an "eventListener" set on the "document"
					because of the presence of the component) render is the most important
					lifecycle method and the only required one in any component. It is usually
					called every time the component's state is updated, which should be reflected
					in the user interface. JSX Main article: JSX JSX, or JavaScript Syntax
					Extension, is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax.[25] Similar
					in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to structure component rendering
					using syntax familiar to many developers. React components are typically
					written using JSX, although they do not have to be (components may also
					be written in pure JavaScript). JSX is similar to another extension syntax
					created by Facebook for PHP called XHP. Common idioms React does not attempt
					to provide a complete "application library". It is designed specifically
					for building user interfaces[3] and therefore does not include many of
					the tools some developers might consider necessary to build an application.
					This allows the choice of whichever libraries the developer prefers to
					accomplish tasks such as performing network access or local data storage.
					Common patterns of usage have emerged as the library matures. Unidirectional
					data flow To support React's concept of unidirectional data flow (which
					might be contrasted with AngularJS's bidirectional flow), the Flux architecture
					was developed as an alternative to the popular model–view–controller architecture.
					Flux features actions which are sent through a central dispatcher to a
					store, and changes to the store are propagated back to the view.[29] When
					used with React, this propagation is accomplished through component properties.
					Since its conception, Flux has been superseded by libraries such as Redux
					and MobX.[30] Flux can be considered a variant of the observer pattern.[31]
					A React component under the Flux architecture should not directly modify
					any props passed to it, but should be passed callback functions that create
					actions which are sent by the dispatcher to modify the store. The action
					is an object whose responsibility is to describe what has taken place:
					for example, an action describing one user "following" another might contain
					a user id, a target user id, and the type USER_FOLLOWED_ANOTHER_USER.[32]
					The stores, which can be thought of as models, can alter themselves in
					response to actions received from the dispatcher. This pattern is sometimes
					expressed as "properties flow down, actions flow up". Many implementations
					of Flux have been created since its inception, perhaps the most well-known
					being Redux, which features a single store, often called a single source
					of truth.[33] In February 2019, useReducer was introduced as a React hook
					in the 16.8 release. It provides an API that is consistent with Redux,
					enabling developers to create Redux-like stores that are local to component
					states.[34] Future development Project status can be tracked via the core
					team discussion forum.[35] However, major changes to React go through the
					Future of React repository issues and pull requests.[36][37] This enables
					the React community to provide feedback on new potential features, experimental
					APIs and JavaScript syntax improvements. History React was created by Jordan
					Walke, a software engineer at Meta, who released an early prototype of
					React called "FaxJS".[38][39] He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component
					library for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011
					and later on Instagram in 2012.[citation needed] It was open-sourced at
					JSConf US in May 2013.[39] React Native, which enables native Android,
					iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's React
					Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015. On April 18, 2017,
					Facebook announced React Fiber, a new set of internal algorithms for rendering,
					as opposed to React's old rendering algorithm, Stack.[40] React Fiber was
					to become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development
					of the React library.[41][needs update] The actual syntax for programming
					with React does not change; only the way that the syntax is executed has
					changed.[42] React's old rendering system, Stack, was developed at a time
					when the focus of the system on dynamic change was not understood. Stack
					was slow to draw complex animation, for example, trying to accomplish all
					of it in one chunk. Fiber breaks down animation into segments that can
					be spread out over multiple frames. Likewise, the structure of a page can
					be broken into segments that may be maintained and updated separately.
					JavaScript functions and virtual DOM objects are called "fibers", and each
					can be operated and updated separately, allowing for smoother on-screen
					rendering.[43] On September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the public.[44]
					On August 10, 2023, the React team announced the first release candidate
					for React v17.0, notable as the first major release without major changes
					to the React developer-facing API.[45] On March 29, 2022, React 18 was
					released which introduced a new concurrent renderer, automatic batching
					and support for server side rendering with Suspense.[46] Licensing The
					initial public release of React in May 2013 used the Apache License 2.0.
					In October 2014, React 0.12.00 replaced this with the 3-clause BSD license
					and added a separate PATENTS text file that permits usage of any Facebook
					patents related to the software:[47] The license granted hereunder will
					terminate, automatically and without notice, for anyone that makes any
					claim (including by filing any lawsuit, assertion or other action) alleging
					(a) direct, indirect, or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe
					any patent: (i) by Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether
					or not such claim is related to the Software, (ii) by any party if such
					claim arises in whole or in part from any software, product or service
					of Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether or not such
					claim is related to the Software, or (iii) by any party relating to the
					Software; or (b) that any right in any patent claim of Facebook is invalid
					or unenforceable. This unconventional clause caused some controversy and
					debate in the React user community, because it could be interpreted to
					empower Facebook to revoke the license in many scenarios, for example,
					if Facebook sues the licensee prompting them to take "other action" by
					publishing the action on a blog or elsewhere. Many expressed concerns that
					Facebook could unfairly exploit the termination clause or that integrating
					React into a product might complicate a startup company's future acquisition.[48]
					Based on community feedback, Facebook updated the patent grant in April
					2015 to be less ambiguous and more permissive:[49] The license granted
					hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice, if you (or
					any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate directly
					or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent Assertion:
					(i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates,
					(ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or in part
					from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of
					its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating
					to the Software. [...] A "Patent Assertion" is any lawsuit or other action
					alleging direct, indirect, or contributory infringement or inducement to
					infringe any patent, including a cross-claim or counterclaim.[50] The Apache
					Software Foundation considered this licensing arrangement to be incompatible
					with its licensing policies, as it "passes along risk to downstream consumers
					of our software imbalanced in favor of the licensor, not the licensee,
					thereby violating our Apache legal policy of being a universal donor",
					and "are not a subset of those found in the [Apache License 2.0], and they
					cannot be sublicensed as [Apache License 2.0]".[51] In August 2017, Facebook
					dismissed the Apache Foundation's downstream concerns and refused to reconsider
					their license.[52][53] The following month, WordPress decided to switch
					its Gutenberg and Calypso projects away from React.[54] On September 23,
					2017, Facebook announced that the following week, it would re-license Flow,
					Jest, React, and Immutable.js under a standard MIT License; the company
					stated that React was "the foundation of a broad ecosystem of open source
					software for the web", and that they did not want to "hold back forward
					progress for nontechnical reasons".[55] On September 26, 2017, React 16.0.0
					was released with the MIT license.[56] The MIT license change has also
					been backported to the 15.x release line with React 15.6.2.[57] *Wikipedia
